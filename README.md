# Topic-Modelling
Topic modeling is a technique in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (Machine Learning) used to automatically discover hidden topics (topics). latent) in a large set of documents. This topic helps to understand and summarize the main content of the texts without having to read each document.

I use 3 models to search for topics: 

First about the recently emerged algorithm Bertopic(Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer)

Next, the most popular algorithm used for topic modeling is LSA (Latent semantic analysis).

In addition, the team also makes deep learning models such as RNN and CNN to evaluate topic classification and make applications for development.
